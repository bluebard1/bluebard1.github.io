                Born on the verge of two millenia I first glanced the light of day on December 23rd 1999. With a hefty
                weight of 3.7kg my parents knew they had just received a winner. A winner of a lot of eating contests that is...
                
                <br><br>
                While spending most of my childhood in flatland - locally also known as "Burgenland" - the most eastern region of
                Austria I got to experience a dense mix of urban and provincial Austrian lifestyle as well as nothern-african 
                hospitality and laidbackness. 
                Growing up and aside from attending school music, martial-arts 
                and quite obviously japanese videogames and TV-shows were things with the capability to bring enormous joy. 
                The quirky kid had quite a blast... 
                <br><br>
                Nowadays if I'm not strolling around on campus I spend my time working part time to finance me and my studies
                (they can be quite picky sometime), helping out at "Voluntarily for Vienna" alongside with geeking out from time
                to time and doing the occasional burpee to stay in shape.
